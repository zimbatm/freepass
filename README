FreePass
========

Per-site unique password using a password generator
where domain+master-password => unique password for the site



Desing
------

Three-stage loading:
 * minimal bookmarklet (not implemented yet)
 * bookmarklet.js.php
 * index.php

Secure inter-window communication using the new window.postMessage API.

FreePass vs SuperGenPass
------------------------

- Needs internet connection
+ Not vulnerable to dom tempering
+ Forkable project

Security
--------

It is possible, like SuperGenPass to detect the addition of FreePass to the page.
Unlike SuperGenPass, it is not possible for another script to find the password element and read it's value, since it lives in another window, on another domain (the browser protects it).

FreePass mobile semi-vulnerability: by copying the password in the clipboard, it lets other running applications (any flash?) capture a website's password.

Future ideas
------------

* Implement an optional storage to remember specific site passwords. (and user login)
