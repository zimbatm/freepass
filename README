FreePass
========

Per-site unique password using a password generator
where domain+master-password => unique password for the site



Desing
------

Three-stage loading:
 * minimal bookmarklet
 * bookmarklet.js.php
 * index.php

"Secure" iframe communication channel


FreePass vs SuperGenPass
------------------------

- Needs internet connection
+ Not vulnerable to dom tempering
+ Forkable project

Security
--------

It is possible, like SuperGenPass to detect the addition of FreePass to the page.
Unlike SuperGenPass, it is not possible for another script to find the password element and read it's value, since it lives in another frame, on another domain.

However, this method, like SuperGenPass suffers from the overlaying capture technique.
By putting an invisible element on top of the iframe, it is possible to capture keyboard events and guess the password that way.


Future ideas
------------

* Implement an optional storage to remember specific site passwords. (and user login)
